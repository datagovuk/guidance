To publish on data.gov.uk, you must have an administrator (admin) or editor account.

Both accounts allow you to create and edit datasets.
If you have an admin account for your organisation you’ll also be responsible for:

* adding editor and admin accounts
* updating details about your organisation 

### Permissions explained

Admins can also:

* approve editor requests
* respond to FOI requests (unless otherwise specified by the publisher)
* create new editors or admins
* manage the activity of editors

Editors can also:

* manage and configure the harvesting for their organisation

### How to get an account

1. Go to <http://data.gov.uk/user/register>. Choose a username and password to complete the registration. Click 'Create new account'.

2. We'll send an email within 30 minutes asking you to confirm the account details. We recommend checking your spam folder if you can't see the email. Once you've validated your email address,  we'll activate the account.

3. You must confirm your email address within 5 days. After this, you'll need to start again and create a new account.

Once you have an account, you will need to request to become an editor or admin for your organisation.


### Become an editor or admin

1. Sign in to your account and go to <https://data.gov.uk/publisher>

2. Search for the publisher and click on the name. 

3. Go to the the administrators icon on the top right of the page. Click on ‘request to become an editor’. This link must be      used to send all requests to become both an editor or admin.

4. Fill out the form adding details about your position to publish data on behalf of the organisation. If you want to become      an admin, you must provide information about the authority you have.

You can make a note of the organisation that your request has been sent to should you need to check the progress of your application. Usually, approved requests take no more than a few days. You’ll receive a confirmation email from the organisation directly. 

If you cannot see the administrators icon it may be because of the security settings on your network. You can go to the correct page by manually editing the URL in your browser by adding ‘apply’. 

 

Once you are an editor or admin you will see the blue "Publisher tools" button when logged in, and can now [publish data](publishing_on_data_gov_uk_overview.html).

# Become an Admin

Follow the same [instructions as for editor](#become-an-editor) but be sure to mention in your request that you would like be the Admin and take responsibility for approving other users for your publisher (and any sub publishers).
